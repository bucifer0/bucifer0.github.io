                     Friday the 13th is a 1980 American independent slasher film produced and directed
                     by Sean S. Cunningham, written by Victor Miller, and starring Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King,
                     Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Mark Nelson, Jeannine Taylor, Robbi Morgan, and Kevin Bacon.
                     Its plot follows a group of teenage camp counselors who are murdered one by one by an unknown
                     killer while they are attempting to re-open an abandoned summer camp with a tragic past.
                     Prompted by the success of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), director Cunningham put out 
                     an advertisement to sell the film in Variety in early 1979, while Miller was still drafting the screenplay
                     .After casting the film in New York City, filming took place in New Jersey in the summer of 1979,
                     on an estimated budget of $550,000. A bidding war ensued over the finished film, ending with
                     Paramount Pictures acquiring the film for domestic distribution, while Warner Bros. 
                     secured international distribution rights.

                  Somewhere in North Africa, Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) purchases an antique puzzle box from a dealer who 
                  asks him "What's your pleasure, Sir?" Back at his house in England, Frank solves the puzzle box and hooked 
                  chains immediately fly out of the box and tear into his flesh. Demons called Cenobites from another realm appear to
                  inspect Frank's remains. Their leader, Pinhead (Doug Bradley), searches among the shreds of flesh and blood and reassembles
                  the pieces of Frank's face. He finds the mysterious box and twists it back into its original state, and the room appears
                  empty as if nothing ever happened.

                  On a cold Halloween night in 1963, six year old Michael Myers brutally murdered his 17-year-old sister, Judith.
                  He was sentenced and locked away for 15 years. But on October 30, 1978, while being transferred for a court date,
                  a 21-year-old Michael Myers steals a car and escapes Smith's Grove. He returns to his quiet hometown of Haddonfield,
                  Illinois, where he looks for his next victims.
