                <h1>Nannar (Sin)</h1>
                <p>
                    Nannar (/sin/) or Suen (Akkadian:𒀭𒂗𒍪) also known as Nanna
                    was the Mesopotamian god representing
                    the moon. While these two names originate in two different languages,
                    respectively Akkadian and Sumerian, they were already used interchangeably
                    to refer to one deity in the Early Dynastic period. They were sometimes combined
                    into the double name Nanna-Suen. A third well attested name is Dilimbabbar
                    (𒀭𒀸𒁽𒌓). Additionally, the moon god could be represented by logograms
                    reflecting his lunar character, such as d30 (𒀭𒌍), referring to days
                    in the lunar month or dU4.SAKAR (𒀭𒌓𒊬), derived from a term referring
                    to the crescent. In addition to his astral role, Sin was also closely 
                    associated with cattle herding.
                    Furthermore, there is some evidence that he could serve as a judge
                    of the dead in the underworld.

                <p>
                    While it is agreed that the two primary names of the Mesopotamian moon god,
                    Nanna and Sin (Suen), originated in two different languages, respectively
                    Sumerian and Akkadian, it is not possible to differentiate between them as
                    designations of separate deities, as they effectively fully merged at an
                    early date. Gebhard J. Selz [de] points out this phenomenon is already
                    attested in sources from Lagash from the Early Dynastic period, where the
                    name Nanna does not appear, and Sin is the form used in both Sumerian and
                    Akkadian context. The process of conflation presumably started prior
                    to the invention of cuneiform.

                <h3>Nanna</h3>
                The precise etymology of the name Nanna is unknown,[3] though it is agreed that it is
                not a genitive construction.[11] It is first attested in the Uruk period.[12] In earliest
                cuneiform texts from Uruk and Ur it was written as (d)LAK-32.NA, with NA possibly serving
                as a phonetic complement.[3] The name of the city of Ur (Urim) was accordingly written as 
                LAK-32.UNUGki (𒋀𒀕𒆠), "residence of Nanna", per analogy with toponyms such as Zabalam,
                INANNA.UNUGki.[1] In later periods LAK-32 coalesced with ŠEŠ (the ideogram for "brother"),
                and Nanna's name came to be written as dŠEŠ+KI or dŠEŠ.KI, though phonetic spellings such
                as na-an-na are attested too, for example as glosses in lexical lists.[3]
                <h3>Sin</h3>
                In Akkadian the moon god was called Sin (Sîn) or Suen (Su’en).[1] The former is the standard
                reading of the name from the Old Babylonian period onward, while the latter was presumably the
                older uncontracted pronunciation.[14] The etymology of this name remains uncertain.[15] One of
                the inscriptions of Gudea from the third millennium BCE refers to Sin as a god "whose name nobody
                can explain", which might be an indication that his name was already unclear and a subject of scribal
                speculation during his reign.[16]

                <p>
                    Despite Sin's popularity documented in textual sources, depictions of him are
                    not common in Mesopotamian art.[75] His most common attribute was the crescent.
                    [3][76] In accordance with the appearance of the new moon in the latitude of
                    Mesopotamia, it was consistently represented as recumbent.[77] It was frequently
                    compared to bull horns[3] and to a barge.[44] On seals, Sin could be depicted
                    with the crescent either placed on his tiara[75] or atop a standard he held.
                    [78] It was also used to represent him on kudurru, decorated boundary stones.
                    [79] It consistently occurs in the upper section of such objects, next to
                    symbols of Shamash and Ishtar, though their exact arrangement can vary.[80]
                    A survey of 110 stones or their fragments indicated that this trio of deities
                    is depicted on all known kudurru.[79] Aniconic portrayals of Sin as the lunar
                    crescent also predominate in Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian art.[81] Furthermore,
                    the logogram dU4.SAKAR (𒀭𒌓𒊬) which could be used to write his name was derived
                    from a term referring to the crescent.[3]
                    <h3>Associations with other deities</h3>
                    Enlil and Ninlil were usually regarded as Sin's parents.[91] It has been argued
                    that an Early Dynastic text from Abu Salabikh already refers to Enlil and Ninlil
                    as his parents, though an alternate view is that he oldest certain evidence only
                    goes back to the reign of Ur-Nammu of the Third Dynasty of Ur.[92] It has been
                    argued that in this period he might have started to be viewed as a son of Enlil
                    for political reasons.[93] The compilers of the god list An = Anum apparently
                    did not acknowledge this tradition directly, as in contrast with Ninurta Sin
                    does not appear in the section focused on Enlil and his family.[92]
                    <h3>Wife and Children</h3>
                    Sin's wife was Ningal.[9] They are already attested as a couple in Early Dynastic sources,
                    [100] and they were consistently paired with each other in all regions of Mesopotamia.[101]
                    Derivatives of Ningal were associated with local moon gods in the Ugaritic, Hurrian and Hittite
                    pantheons.[9] However, the old proposal that Hurrians, and by extension Hittites and inhabitants
                    of Ugarit, received her from Harran is regarded as unproven, as she does not appear in
                    association with this city in any sources from the second millennium BCE.[102] She is also
                    absent from Luwian sources pertaining to the worship of Sin of Harran in the first millennium
                    BCE.[103] The best attested children of Sin were Utu (Shamash) and Inanna (Ishtar).[9]
                    The connection between these three deities depended on their shared astral character,
                    with Sin representing the moon and his children, who could be identified as twins
                    - the sun and Venus.

                <h1>As Head Of The Pantheon</h1>
                <p>
                    A number of sources attest the existence of a tradition in which Sin was regarded as
                    the sole head of the Mesopotamian pantheon or a deity equal in rank to the traditional
                    kings of the gods, Anu and Enlil.[64] According to Wilfred G. Lambert, most of the evidence
                    for this view postdates the reign of Meli-Shipak II, and indicates it might have been particularly
                    popular in Harran.[65] An Old Babylonian literary composition written in Sumerian describes Sin as
                    the head of the divine assembly (Ubšu’ukkin),with Anu, Enlil, Inanna, Utu, Enki and Ninhursag serving
                    as his advisers.[66] Two of his titles known from the god list An = Anum, dUkkin ("the assembly") and
                    Ukkin-uru ("mighty assembly"), might reflect this portrayal.[52] Some Old Babylonian theophoric names
                    might also be connected to the view that Sin was the head of the pantheon, namely Sîn-bēl-ili
                    ("Sin is the lord of the gods"), Sîn-šar-ili ("Sin is the king of the gods") or Sîn-il-ili 
                    ("Sin is god of the gods").[67] Lambert notes that while similar names invoking other gods,
                    for example Shamash and Adad, are also known, Sîn-bēl-ili is ultimately the most common.

                <h2>Worship</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Sin was recognized as a major deity all across ancient Mesopotamia.[151] His status was already high
                    in the earliest periods to which the history of the Mesopotamian pantheon can be traced.[152] It is 
                    presumed that Sin was actively worshiped in most of the major cities of the region, with remains of
                    multiple temples dedicated to him identified during excavations both in Babylonia and in Assyria.[153]
                    <h3>Early Histroy</h3>
                    Ur was already well established as the cult center of the moon god, initially under his Sumerian
                    name Nanna, in Early Dynastic times, as attested in the zami hymns from Abu Salabikh.[30]
                    His primary temple this city was Ekišnugal,[154] "house of the great light".[155]
                    Sanctuaries bearing this name also existed in other cities, which is presumed to
                    reflect Ur's central importance in the sphere of religion.[156] The first certain 
                    attestation of this ceremonial name has been dated to the reign of Utu-hegal,
                    though it is possible it was already used in the times of Eannatum.
                    <h3>The en priestesses</h3>
                    An important aspect of the lunar cult in Ur was the institution of the en priestess.
                    [165] In Akkadian its holders were referred to as entum.[166] Their residence was known
                    as Gipar, and while initially separate in the Old Babylonian period it was combined into
                    a single complex with the temple of the moon god's wife, Ningal.[167] Not much is known
                    about the duties of the en in the sphere of cult, though they apparently played a
                    role in building and renovation activities.[168] They are chiefly documented in
                    sources from between the Sargonic and early Old Babylonian periods.[166] They were typically daughters of kings.[165]
