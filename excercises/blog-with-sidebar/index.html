                    Personally I don't regret it at all as I was already actively looking to pick
                    up a new ring or two and while Chrome Hearts does make a lot of really corny gaudy
                    shit some of their pieces have an aesthetic I really enjoy which is rare for me considering
                    i'm especially picky with jewellery. I think that despite the value objectively not really being
                    there with the price tag the disparity is excusable for me personally because I really liked the piece
                    and sort of wanted something as a take home from my visit at the store anyways, since that's something
                    I like to do when I get the opportunity to visit stores that I happen to be near during travel. Whether
                    or not their designs appeal to you enough to justify the mark-up is obviously a different story but that's
                    kind of my logic when going about purchasing designer clothing in general considering more often than
                    not value isn't exactly the priority in a sense.

                    Although a different vision from his first brand of Sleazyatl
                    clothing brand which he discontinued, you could find most of his stuff
                    for about 50$. But beware theyre are reviews that your order may take a 
                    while to get to you.

                    Japanese designer Mihara Yasuhiro started his career in the fashion
                    industry by first studying at Tama Art University in Tokyo. While there,
                    he learned how to express his creative vision through a widespread element
                    in daily life—shoes. Shortly after graduating, Yasuhiro started working for
                    the renowned Issey Miyake, the late fashion designer revered for his avant
                    garde designs and innovative use of technology and materials. This experienc
                    e helped lay the foundation for Mihara’s future success in the fashion industry.
                    Mihara’s Japanese heritage and background have influenced the brand’s design aesthetic
                    and creative direction. It has also helped the label receive an international
                    and global following.
