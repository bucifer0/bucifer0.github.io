                The role of the
            
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_designer">graphic designer</a> 
             
                in the communication process is that
                of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the interpretation,
                ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses 
                the aesthetics of typography and the compositional arrangement of the text,
                ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and 
                attitudes beyond what language
                alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, 
                a demand that ends
                up being established linguistically, either orally 
                or in writing, that is, that 
                graphic design transforms a linguistic 
                message into a graphic manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup> 
        </p>

        <p>
                Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of 
                knowledge focused
                on any visual communication system. For example, it can be 
                applied in advertising strategies,
                or it can also be applied in the aviation world<sup>[8]</sup> or 
                space exploration.<sup>[9][10]</sup> In this sense,
                in some countries graphic design is related as only 
                associated with the production of sketches and drawings
                , this is incorrect, since visual communication is a
                small part of a huge range of types and classes 
                where it can be applied.

        <p>
                With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,<sup>[11]</sup> 
                graphic design as applied art was initially
                linked to the boom of rise of printing in Europe in the
                15th century and the growth of consumer 
                culture in the Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged 
                as a distinct profession in the West, closely
                associated with advertising in the 19th century<sup>[12]</sup> and its evolution 
                allowed its consolidation in the 
                20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information 
                exchange today, the demand for experienced 
                designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the 
                development of new technologies and the need to pay attention
                to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who 
                develop them.<sup>[13]</sup>
